Problem set solutions 1-6 submitted by Simona Vasiliauskaite G00263352 using [Python](https://www.python.org/).

**Python** is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.

## PROBLEM SETS:

### 1. File fib.py contains
* exercise 1

Change the program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers. Take A as the number 1, B as 2, C as 3, and so on. For example, my name is Ian, so I should calculate the 25th Fibonacci number because I is 9 and n is 14, giving 25 in total. 

* exercise 2

Change the string variable to contain your own surname, and rerun it. Can you figure out what ord() does? Try to Google it to find out. Post the output of the program, along with any insight you have as to what ord() does,


### 2. File collatz.py
* contains exercise 3

### 3. File projecteuler5.py
* contains exercise 4

### 4. File irisdata.py
* contains exercise 5

### 5. File factorial.py
* contains exercise 6
