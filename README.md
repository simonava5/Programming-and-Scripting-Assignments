# Programming-and-Scripting-Assignments

Problem set solutions 1-6 submitted by Simona Vasiliauskaite G00263352 using [Python](https://www.python.org/).

**Python** is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. (Taken from [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/) website.)

## PROBLEM SETS:

### 1. File fib.py contains
* exercise 1

Change the program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers. Take A as the number 1, B as 2, C as 3, and so on. For example, my name is Ian, so I should calculate the 25th Fibonacci number because I is 9 and n is 14, giving 25 in total. 

* exercise 2

Change the string variable to contain your own surname, and rerun it. Can you figure out what ord() does? Try to Google it to find out. Post the output of the program, along with any insight you have as to what ord() does,


### 2. File collatz.py contains
* exercise 3

Write a single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement. At each iteration, the current value of the integer should be printed to the screen. You can specify in your code the starting value of 17. If you wish to enhance your program, have the program ask the user for the integer instead of specifying a value at the start of your code. 

### 3. File projecteuler5.py contains
* exercise 4

2,520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. Write a Python program using for and range to calculate the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20.

### 4. File irisdata.py
* contains exercise 5

### 5. File factorial.py
* contains exercise 6
